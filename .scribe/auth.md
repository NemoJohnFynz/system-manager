# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"{YOUR_JWT_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your JWT token by logging in via the /api/login endpoint.
